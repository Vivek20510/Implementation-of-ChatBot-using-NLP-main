# Implementation of ChatBot using NLP

This repository contains the implementation of a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project demonstrates how to build an interactive conversational agent capable of understanding and responding to user inputs.

## Features
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Communicate with the chatbot in natural language.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Leverages NLP techniques for understanding user queries.
- **Customizable Responses**: Easily modify and extend the bot’s responses.
- **Modular Design**: Well-structured codebase for easy scalability and maintenance.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit)
  - `re` (Regular Expressions)
  - `json` (Data Parsing)
  - `pickle` (Data Serialization)

## Prerequisites
Before running the chatbot, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries (can be installed using the command below)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vivek20510/Implementation-of-ChatBot-using-NLP-main.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Implementation-of-ChatBot-using-NLP-main
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the chatbot:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch the chatbot using the command above.
2. Enter your query in the terminal and receive a response from the chatbot.
3. Customize intents and responses in the `data/` directory to extend the chatbot’s functionality.

## Customization
To adapt the chatbot to your needs:
- **Modify the Intent File**: Update the `data/intents.json` file with custom intents and responses.
- **Enhance NLP Logic**: Modify the `chatbot_logic.py` script to incorporate additional NLP techniques or preprocessing steps.
